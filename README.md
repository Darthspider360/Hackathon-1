## User Design
It’s a single player game, like a story book with plenty fun small puzzle and events leveraging random number, it gives vibes of adventure and fun, which is suitable for a younger age pupil to play but adults certainly can appreciate and enjoy the imaginary artwork by AI.  

### Wireframes

### Colour Scheme and Images

The colour scheme chagnes depending on the location you enter. The main map colour scheme is that of an old vintage map colour to make you feel like you are looking at an old map. Each icon on the map reflects its own colour scheme to set the tone before entering its quest line map. This is to help with the immersion despite it only being a web based RPG. These colour schemes were also paired with their backgorund images to futer enhance this.

### Typography 
When choosing the typography, we wanted to reflect the handmade feeling of Dungeons and Dragons and thus tried to find a hand written "story teller" type font. These were the top choices:

From here, we chose Amatic SC as it was both easy to read but felt as if it were still handwritten.


## Page Features
This RPG is composed by 4 main page features: they are main map, field map, battle map and minigames. main map serves main story, field map provide small areas and events for adventure activities, battle page serves intensive and strategical turn-based battle theme with a variety of mythical creatures, and minigames are for resolving puzzles and take impact on game flows. 

### Main Content
#### Role of AI
The Codepilot has provided majority of images like spooky castle, mythical creatures and event themes. AI also served as a major assistant coder follow developer's thoughts. Majority of time the developer can command AI and expect for solid logic and very few bugs through JavaScript and only in small occasions Human needs to take over to remove or trim down some overgrown code from AI or ask AI to mitigate bugs found. However, when the codebase keeps growing, AI can show some performance bottleneck and could fail to generate results sometimes, but in this scale of project, AI is still proven a robust tool for developer.   


#### Main Map

We asked AI to create the background for most of the pages, starting with the main map for the land.

Using this image we added icons from font awesome that reflected the quest areas.

#### Minigames

Both minigames were acquired from the internet and then amended for styling purposes.

#### Combat System

The combat system was mainly hand-coded but the code was optimised and cleaned up through chatGPT.
