## User Design


### Wireframes

### Colour Scheme and Images

The colour scheme chagnes depending on the location you enter. The main map colour scheme is that of an old vintage map colour to make you feel like you are looking at an old map. Each icon on the map reflects its own colour scheme to set the tone before entering its quest line map. This is to help with the immersion despite it only being a web based RPG. These colour schemes were also paired with their backgorund images to futer enhance this.

### Typography 
When choosing the typography, we wanted to reflect the handmade feeling of Dungeons and Dragons and thus tried to find a hand written "story teller" type font. These were the top choices:

From here, we chose Amatic SC as it was both easy to read but felt as if it were still handwritten.


## Page Features



### Main Content

#### Main Map

We asked AI to create the background for most of the pages, starting with the main map for the land.

Using this image we added icons from font awesome that reflected the quest areas.

#### Minigames

Both minigames were acquired from the internet and then amended for styling purposes.

2. Went to the repository
3. Click the Settings button near the top of the page
4. Navigated to the Pages button
5. Chose 'main' from the drop-down
6. Selected 'root' from the drop-down folder menu in branch menu
7. Saved adn then waited a short while for the link to be generated.
